<span class="cyan">[001] Introduction</span>
__________________________________________________________________

The PocketKings project was developed within the scope of the
Professional Aptitude Test, which is the final project of the IT
Systems Management and Programming professional course.

<span class="cyan">[002] Project Overview</span>
__________________________________________________________________

PocketKings is a online casino application featuring custom-built
games developed using Tauri, Go, and Unity. 
      
Initially started in late November 2023, it was conceived as a way
to further explore web development and introduce new programming
concepts and languages. The focus eventually shifted to developing
an online casino application, which would integrate multiple areas
of programming, including the app itself, its API, and the games.

<span class="cyan">[003] Project Architecture</span>
__________________________________________________________________

The PocketKings project is divided into three main components:

 - <span class="orange">Application:</span> The front-end interface is built using Tauri and
   React, and the back-end is developed with Rust. Tauri was
   chosen over other frameworks due to its superior performance
   and security features.

 - <span class="orange">API:</span> The API is responsible for managing user authentication,
   transactions, and betting processes. To boost performance,
   a Redis server was integrated to store sessions data by caching
   data in memory.

 - <span class="orange">Games:</span> The games were developed using Unity and compiled to
   WebGL applications to integrate them into the main application.
   Initially, external libraries for the casino games were
   considered, but due to the lack of suitable options, I decided
   to create the games personally with Unity for better
   performance and compatibility.
